                    <p>
                        Genshin Impact is an open-world action RPG game where players can explore the fantasy world of Teyvat.

The game uses a gacha system where players can unlock new characters and weapons in limited-time events.

                        Form a group with up to four characters, each with unique abilities and elemental powers. Switch between characters during combat to create effective elemental combinations. Each character has a normal attack, an elemental skill, and an elemental burst for diverse combat strategies. To achieve a better experience, build up your characters by collecting materials in various types of domains, gathering local specialties, and forming better team combinations.

                        Elemental reactions can also enhance the player's experience by boosting a character's damage output and/or adding additional reaction damage. To further increase damage, players can equip all characters with sets of artifacts to boost their statistics.

                    <h2>Adventure Rank and Progression</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your progress is tracked by your Adventure Rank (AR). Players can increase their AR by completing quests, exploring, and defeating enemies. Higher AR levels unlock new content, challenges, and better rewards, encouraging continuous exploration and engagement. In many situations, certain domains are locked to ensure that players are at suitable levels to clear them.
                
                        <br/><br/>
                
                        In some cases, the main character's (the Traveler) ascension materials are only collectible at certain AR levels since the material is a one-time use and not a collectible.
                
                        <br/><br/>
                
                        Increasing your AR also increases the World Level at certain AR milestones. At these AR milestones, players need to clear a special domain to level up their World Level. By increasing the World Level, enemy drop rates and levels increase, providing a more challenging and rewarding experience.
                
                        <br/><br/>
                
                        Progression also includes Main Quests and Side Quests. By completing these, players can receive rewards such as in-game money (Mora), special currency (Primordial Gems/Primogems), or character level-up materials. The Main Quest, also known as the <i>Archon Quest</i>, revolves around each nation's deities called <i>Archons</i>, who possess the authority over their respective elements.
                
                        <br/><br/>
                
                        The Side Quests are divided into four categories:

                            <li>

                        Genshin Impact supports a multiplayer mode called Co-op, allowing players to team up with friends. Co-op mode can be unlocked at Adventure Rank 16, enabling players to explore the world and tackle challenges together, enhancing the social aspect of the game. However, there are certain limitations in joining others, such as incompatible World Levels. If the host's World Level is too high, players with lower World Levels can't join to prevent any issues on both the developer's and player's sides.

                        When playing in Co-op mode, players can interact with each other to clear domains, collect bosses' materials, and gather many other resources together. By playing in Co-op mode, players can unlock new combat strategies during fights with certain bosses.

                        During some limited events, players can play minigames together and claim generous rewards by encouraging their friends to participate. Since these events are one-time-only, players get to enjoy them as special memories, increasing their enthusiasm to keep playing the game.
